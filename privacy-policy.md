# OpenRoads Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 15 February 2026

---

## General

Openroads Group PTY LTD (32660507951), ("us," "we," or "the Company") respect the privacy of the users of our websites ("Sites"), mobile applications ("App"), our customers and other individuals who interact with us. We have created this privacy policy to explain how we collect, store, use and disclose personal information across both our Sites and our App.

Access to our privacy policy is free. If you would like us to post you a copy of our privacy policy, or have any questions about it or its contents, please call us on +61 458 505 886.

Personal information is defined in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ("Privacy Act") as:

> "Information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:
>
> a) Whether the information or opinion is true or not; and
> b) Whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not."

The Privacy Act was most recently amended on 12 March 2014. The new legislation includes thirteen Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). The APPs regulate the way companies collect, use, hold and disclose personal information.

Our practices and internal policies are consistent with our obligations under the Privacy Act and our staff are required to ensure compliance as a condition of their employment. In any third-party contracts we enter into there is a duty to maintain personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and in a manner consistent with the Privacy Act.

From time to time we will update this privacy policy without prior notice. We will notify you by updating the policy published on our Sites and within the App.

## How and Why We Collect Personal Information

The Company collects personal information in a number of ways. The most common ways we collect personal information include:

- **Application forms** (online, hard copy, or completed via telephone): when individuals register for our events, subscribe to marketing or communications lists, for the purpose of providing news, information, offers and other services in accordance with terms and conditions of the club or list.
- **Competition entries and promotions**: where individuals provide personal information at the time of entry via the competition entry form. Personal information is collected for the purpose of running the competition or promotion, determining and contacting the winner(s) and, unless otherwise noted, to use for direct marketing purposes including to send marketing communications via electronic means.
- **Order forms** (online, hard copy, or via telephone): when goods and services are ordered by distributors and retailers — for the purpose of fulfilling the order and delivering the goods, and to maintain our relationship with the individual concerned.
- **Telephone, email, written and in-person enquiries** directed to us: for the purposes of responding to enquiries.
- **Business contacts**, including contracts and business cards: when you enter into transactions with us or otherwise interact with us in a business context.
- **Online or hard copy surveys**: for the purpose of reviewing and analysing the results and following up on results.
- **Messages or comments** submitted to us via the Site or App which may include personal information such as your name, email address and telephone number.
- **Ticketing agencies**: from our primary ticketing agency when individuals have given the ticketing agency permission to provide the individuals' personal information to presenters/producers related to the event for the purpose of providing information about future events.
- **Public registers** including social networks such as LinkedIn: if you have made this information available, for the purpose of obtaining your contact details.
- **Cookies and automatic processes** on our Sites: cookies are used to better understand users and improve the layout and functionality of our Sites by collecting information such as date, time and duration of visits and which pages are most commonly accessed. This tracking is conducted in such a way as to ensure the anonymity of visitors. While cookies may identify the computer, it should not identify the individual. With most internet browsers, users can erase cookies from their computer's hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, some parts of the Site may not function fully for users that disallow cookies.
- **Our mobile application**: as described in the [Mobile Application](#mobile-app) section below.

Our Sites may collect other information that may or may not be personal information. For each visitor to the Site, our server automatically recognises and stores the individual's IP address, the type of internet browser being used, the address of the site that "referred" the individual to our website, and clickstream data. If this information cannot be used or combined with other data to identify you, it will not be personal information.

We also collect personal information for the purpose of providing you with any goods or services that you request, to update our Sites, to improve the services or goods that we provide and to develop our business.

## What Personal Information Is Collected?

We aim to only collect personal information that is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which you have disclosed it, or as required by law.

If you ask us to provide you with information, goods or services, sign up to join one of our clubs or mailing lists, or submit a competition entry form, you will be asked to provide contact information (such as your name, telephone number, postal address and email address). You may also be asked for demographic information (such as your age and gender) and/or profile data.

In some instances we may need to ask you for additional information necessary to provide you with the goods or services you have requested. When we ask you for further information in addition to that you provide to us initially, we will tell you why we are collecting that information.

We aim to only collect information that is absolutely necessary to provide you with any service you have requested. If you would prefer to remain anonymous, we are happy to still deal with you provided that we don't need to know who you are. Instances where this may be possible include where you are providing us with anonymous feedback that does not require a response.

We do not collect sensitive personal information.

## Mobile Application — OpenRoads Rally App

{: #mobile-app}

This section applies specifically to users of the **OpenRoads Rally** mobile application, available on Android and iOS. The App is a rally event management and tracking tool that enables riders to navigate rally tracks, record their routes, and auto-complete checkpoints using GPS.

### Data We Collect Through the App

#### Account Information

When you create an account in the App, we collect the following personal information:

| Data                                       | Purpose                                                                              |
| :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email address**                          | Account identification and communication                                             |
| **First name and surname**                 | Personalising your profile and ride logs                                             |
| **Phone number**                           | Contact information (entered during onboarding or profile editing)                   |
| **Profile photo**                          | Personalising your profile (captured via camera or selected from your photo library) |
| **Account creation and update timestamps** | Account management                                                                   |

You may create an account using **email and password**, **Google Sign-In**, or **Apple Sign-In**. When using social sign-in, we receive your name, email address, and profile photo URL from the respective provider.

#### Location Data

{: #location-data}

**The App collects precise location data (GPS), including when the App is running in the background.**

Location data is central to the App's core functionality — tracking your progress along rally routes and automatically completing checkpoints when you are within proximity. We collect:

| Data                       | Purpose                                                       |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Latitude and longitude** | Recording your rally route and calculating distance travelled |
| **Altitude**               | Recording elevation along your rally route                    |
| **Timestamps**             | Associating each GPS reading with the time it was recorded    |

**When is location collected?**

- Location tracking is active **only when you start a ride** within the App.
- On **Android**, the App uses a **foreground service** (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`) to maintain GPS tracking when the screen is off or the App is in the background. A persistent notification is displayed whenever tracking is active.
- On **iOS**, the App uses **background location mode** to maintain GPS tracking when the App is in the background. A location indicator is displayed in the status bar whenever tracking is active.
- Location tracking **stops** when you end or pause your ride.
- The App does **not** track your location when you are not actively participating in a ride.

**How is location data used?**

- To display your real-time position on the rally route.
- To automatically detect and complete checkpoints when you are within the configured proximity radius.
- To calculate the total distance you have ridden.
- To generate a GPS trail (route recording) of your ride, which is stored as part of your ride log.
- To generate GPX files of your ride for your records.

**Location data is not used for advertising, analytics, or any purpose other than the rally tracking features described above.**

**Permissions required:**

| Permission                    | Platform | Purpose                                                                               |
| :---------------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`        | Android  | Precise GPS tracking during rally rides                                               |
| `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`      | Android  | Required alongside fine location                                                      |
| `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`  | Android  | GPS tracking when the App is in the background or screen is off during an active ride |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` | Android  | Running the foreground location tracking service with a visible notification          |
| Location When In Use          | iOS      | GPS tracking during rally rides                                                       |
| Location Always               | iOS      | GPS tracking when the App is in the background during an active ride                  |

#### Ride Logs

When you complete a ride, the following data is recorded and stored:

- Your rider name and user reference
- The event and track you participated in
- Checkpoints completed and points earned
- Total distance recorded (in kilometres)
- Start and end times of the ride
- Your full GPS trail (raw latitude, longitude, altitude, and timestamps for each recorded point)
- A GPX file of your route

#### Camera and Photo Library

The App requests access to your **camera** and **photo library** solely for the purpose of setting or updating your **profile photo**. Photos are uploaded to our secure cloud storage. We do not access your camera or photo library for any other purpose.

#### Local Data Storage

The App stores certain data locally on your device to support offline functionality:

- **GPS data**: Raw GPS readings are stored temporarily in a local database on your device during a ride. Once the ride is completed and successfully synced to our servers, the local GPS data is cleared.
- **Ride progress**: Your checkpoint completion status and active ride session information are stored locally to ensure continuity if the App is interrupted.
- **User preferences**: Settings such as checkpoint proximity radius and GPS distance filter are stored locally on your device.
- **Event access**: A record of events you have unlocked is stored locally for convenience.

#### Crash Reports and Diagnostics

If the App crashes or encounters an error, we collect **crash reports and diagnostic data** through Firebase Crashlytics. This may include:

- Stack traces and error messages
- Your email address (to help us identify and assist affected users)
- Device information (model, operating system version)

Crash data is only collected in release (production) builds of the App and is used solely for identifying and fixing bugs.

#### Analytics

The App uses Firebase Analytics for basic, **automatic** session and screen usage data. We do **not** log any custom analytics events, and we have **explicitly disabled advertising ID (AD_ID) collection**. Analytics data is used solely to understand general App usage patterns and improve the App experience.

#### Notifications

The App uses **local notifications only** (not push notifications from a remote server). Notifications are triggered on your device to alert you when you are approaching or have reached a checkpoint during an active ride.

A **persistent notification** is also displayed on Android while location tracking is active, as required by the operating system for foreground services.

### Background Services

The App uses background services in the following limited ways:

- **Foreground location tracking**: While you are on an active ride, a foreground service keeps GPS tracking running even when the screen is off or the App is in the background. This service always displays a visible notification so you are aware tracking is active.
- **Background data sync**: If your ride data cannot be uploaded immediately (e.g. due to poor connectivity), the App schedules a one-off background task to upload the data when a network connection becomes available.

### Third-Party Services Used by the App

The App relies on the following third-party services provided by **Google Firebase**:

| Service                     | Data Processed                                        |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Firebase Authentication** | Email, password (hashed), OAuth tokens                |
| **Cloud Firestore**         | User profiles, ride logs, event and track data        |
| **Firebase Storage**        | Profile images, GPX route files                       |
| **Firebase Crashlytics**    | Crash reports, error diagnostics, user email          |
| **Firebase Analytics**      | Automatic session and screen data (no advertising ID) |

When you sign in using **Google Sign-In**, Google receives and processes data as described in [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). When you sign in using **Apple Sign-In**, Apple receives and processes data as described in [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

**We do not share your data with any advertising networks, data brokers, or other third-party services beyond those listed above.** The App does not contain any third-party advertising SDKs.

You may request deletion of your account at any time by contacting us at the details provided below. Upon account deletion:

- Your profile data is archived and subsequently removed from our active database.
- Your profile photo is deleted from cloud storage.
- Your ride logs are deleted.

## Storage of Personal Information

Any information we collect about you will be kept securely by us unless an event beyond our control disrupts the measures we have in place. We use up-to-date security, firewall, anti-virus and encryption software to ensure the security of the data we keep and to prevent unauthorised access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. We have procedures in place with regards to staff access to personal information and ensure that only those staff who need to know have access to your information.

Data collected via the App is stored securely using Google Firebase infrastructure, which employs industry-standard encryption in transit and at rest. Local data stored on your device (such as temporary GPS readings) is held in a private application database that is not accessible to other applications.

We will only store personal information for so long as it is required either to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected or to fulfil our obligations at law. We will conduct regular reviews of the personal information we hold and destroy or de-identify information no longer required.

## Disclosure of Personal Information

Generally, personal information will not be disclosed to individuals or organisations outside of the Company without your prior consent. However, in the circumstances described below, personal information may be disclosed to:

- **Essential service providers**: There may be other companies that we rely on to provide goods or services to you. We may be required to provide your personal information to these companies to ensure that we can deliver goods or services to you.
- **Law enforcement or government bodies**: There are exceptions under the Privacy Act with regards to the provision of personal information to law enforcement or government bodies. When a legitimate request is sent to us by a law enforcement or government body we will comply with that request and may provide personal information about you without your consent.
- **Companies related to us or who take control of part or all of our business**: In providing personal information to us you will need to be aware of the possibility that, in future, another company may take control of part or all of our business. In that case, your personal information will be provided to that company.
- **Firebase / Google Cloud**: As described in the [Mobile Application](#mobile-app) section above, App data is processed and stored using Google Firebase services.

If we disclose personal information to a third party under outsourcing or contracting arrangements (a service provider), we will take steps to ensure that they have:

- Signed a binding agreement (reviewed by our Legal Counsel);
- Handle the personal information in a manner consistent with the APPs (regardless of whether they are a small business, or would otherwise be exempt from the Privacy Act);
- Only use the personal information in order to provide specific services or to perform the specific functions required; and
- Store the personal information securely, and only for as long as is necessary to provide the required services or perform the required functions.

## Overseas Disclosure

Like many organisations, we use IT infrastructure and service providers who are based or hosted in countries other than Australia including the United States, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, United Kingdom, and Malaysia. Google Firebase services may store and process data in data centres located outside of Australia, including in the United States. Where we have a relationship with such providers we ensure that we complete a privacy due diligence on their own practices and procedures to ensure that they are of a high quality. Our contractual arrangements with these providers include obligations of confidence and an obligation to comply with our privacy policy. We complete a re-assessment of overseas providers at least every six months. Australian law may not apply in some of these jurisdictions.

## Access to Personal Information

Under the Privacy Act, you have the right to seek access and to update or correct the personal information that we hold about you. If you wish to exercise your right under the Privacy Act to seek access to the personal information held for you, you should make the request in writing (to the address specified below).

Ordinarily we will not charge for providing access/copies of personal information we hold about you, and will generally respond to access requests of this type within 30 days. If we anticipate there being a fee (for the time we spend locating and compiling the information you have asked for) we will provide you with an estimate before proceeding. If a fee is payable it will be based on an hourly rate plus the cost of photocopying or other out of pocket expenses. For legal and administrative reasons we may also store records containing personal information in archives. Access to these historical records may result in a charge being incurred (an estimate will be provided to you prior). Due to the nature of archive, requests for access to historical records may take longer to process than with current records.

You may correct the personal information we hold about you at any time; you should make the request in writing (to the address specified below). We do not charge a fee to correct personal information held.

On review of your request, if we agree that the personal information held is not accurate, complete and up to date, it will be corrected by the appropriate person. If we do not agree, you will be provided with the reason(s) for the views and the opportunity to make a statement of your view and have it included with the information held.
